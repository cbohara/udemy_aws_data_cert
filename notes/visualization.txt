Some Data sources incude
# Redshift 
# Athena
# File in S3

Data prep allows for limited ETL
# change column names
# issue SQL queries to transform
# change data types
For bigger ETL use glue

Import data into SPICE
Accelerate queries on large data sets


Each user gets 10GB of SPICE
Scales up to 100+ of users

Use cases
# Ad-hoc exploration / visualization
# Dashboards
# Stories - like a slide show, Tableau style
guided stories through specific views of analysis
convey key points, evolution of an analysis over time

Security
# MFA
# VPC connectivity
# Row level security 
# Private VPC access

User management
users created via IAM or email signup
Active directory integration = Enterprise edition

Dashboards
# READ ONLY snapshot of an analysis - other users can't edit
# put together charts + graphs
# automatically refresh

Machine Learning insights
# ML powered anomaly detection
uses Random Cut Forest
identify top contributors to significant changes in metrics
# ML powered forecasting
also uses Random Cut Forest
detects seasonal + longer term trends
excludes outliers and imputes missing values
# Autonarratives
# Suggested insights

Visual types
# AutoGraph - AWS tries to figure out the appropriate visual for you
# Bar chart - comparison of quantities
histogram - bucket things together by certain ranges
# Line graph - changes over time
# Scatter plot + heat map - correlation between 2+ attributes 
# Pie graph - how pieces add up to a whole
# Tree maps - hierarchical pie charts
# Pivot table - slicing + dicing tabular data
# Stories - Capture button - evolution of an analysis
# KPIs - compare key to target value
# Geospatial charts - maps with dots
# Donut charts - similar to pie chart, based on percentages, good to use for revenue reports
# Gauge charts - how much of something you are using (ex: amount of fuel in your tank) 
# Word clouds - size of word = how often it appears
