Lambda
######
in the world of big data - used to process data as it is moved around from one service to another
lambda can be triggered by time like cron
if your code does fail for some reason lambda will automatically retry 3 times? asked more details
lambda must be in the same account as the service triggering it, in addition to having an IAM policy granting it access

######
Kinesis > Lambda
######
kinesis is not pushing data to lambda
lambda polls for data from kinesis stream periodically in batches 
max batch size is 10,000 records
too large of a batch size can cause timeouts (max timeout is 15 minutes)
max batch size is 6MB

if lambda fails it will retry until it succeeds or the data expires
this can stall the shards if you don't handle errors properly
this is because the kinesis stream is just waiting for the lambda to complete before proceeding 
aka lambda processes shard data synchronously 

#####
Lambda Example
#####
need to base64 decode incoming kinesis data records
