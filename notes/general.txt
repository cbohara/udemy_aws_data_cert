# EC2 Instance Types
General purpose = T or M

Compute optimized = C
for batch processing

Memory optimized = R(AM), X, Z
real time data analytics
Spark

Accelerate computing = P, G, F
ML/Deep Learning
TensorFlow, MxNet

Storage optimized = H, I, D
distributed file system (HDFS), MapReduce, Kafka, Redshift

# EC2 in Big Data
Spot - can tolerate loss, using service with checkpointing
Reserved - long running clusters
On Demand - all other scenarios

# Exam Tips
look for key words about requirements 
do not skim through
2.5 min per question
flag questions for later review
no penalty for guessing
